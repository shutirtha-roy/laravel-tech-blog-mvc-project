(20, 'Java (programming language)', '<p><strong>Java </strong>is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is a general-purpose programming language intended to let application developers write once, run anywhere (WORA),[17] meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation.[18] <em>Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine (<strong>JVM</strong>) regardless of the underlying computer architecture.</em> The syntax of Java is similar to C and C++, but has fewer low-level facilities than either of them. The Java runtime provides dynamic capabilities (such as reflection and runtime code modification) that are typically not available in traditional compiled languages. As of 2019, Java was one of the most popular programming languages in use according to GitHub,[19][20] particularly for client-server web applications, with a reported 9 million <em>developers</em>.</p><p>In 1997, Sun Microsystems approached the ISO/IEC JTC 1 standards body and later the Ecma International to formalize Java, but it soon withdrew from the process. Java remains a de facto standard, controlled through the Java Community Process.[32] At one time, Sun made most of its Java implementations available without charge, despite their proprietary software status. Sun generated revenue from Java through the selling of licenses for specialized products such as the Java Enterprise System. On November 13, 2006, Sun released much of its Java virtual machine (JVM) as free and open-source software (FOSS), under the terms of the GPL-2.0-only license. On May 8, 2007, Sun finished the process, making all of its JVM&#39;s core code available under free software/open-source distribution terms, aside from a small portion of code to which Sun did not hold the copyright.[33]</p><p>Sun&#39;s vice-president Rich Green said that Sun&#39;s ideal role with regard to Java was as an evangelist.[34] Following Oracle Corporation&#39;s acquisition of Sun Microsystems in 2009&ndash;10, Oracle has described itself as the steward of Java technology with a relentless commitment to fostering a community of participation and transparency.[35] This did not prevent Oracle from filing a lawsuit against Google shortly after that for using Java inside the Android SDK (see the Android section).</p><p><strong>Documentation</strong></p><p>Javadoc is a comprehensive documentation system, created by Sun Microsystems. It provides developers with an organized system for documenting their code. <em>Javadoc comments have an extra asterisk at the beginning, i.e. the delimiters are /** and */, whereas the normal multi-line comments in Java are set off with the delimiters /* and */, and single-line comments start off the line with //.</em></p><p><strong>Implementations</strong></p><p>Oracle Corporation is the current owner of the official implementation of the Java SE platform, following their acquisition of Sun Microsystems on January 27, 2010. This implementation is based on the original implementation of Java by Sun. The Oracle implementation is available for Microsoft Windows (still works for XP, while only later versions are currently officially supported), macOS, Linux, and Solaris. Because Java lacks any formal standardization recognized by Ecma International, ISO/IEC, ANSI, or other third-party standards organizations, the Oracle implementation is the de facto standard.</p><p>The Oracle implementation is packaged into two different distributions: The Java Runtime Environment (JRE) which contains the parts of the Java SE platform required to run Java programs and is intended for end users, and the Java Development Kit (JDK), which is intended for software developers and includes development tools such as the Java compiler, Javadoc, Jar, and a debugger. <em>Oracle has also released GraalVM, a high performance Java dynamic compiler and interpreter.OpenJDK is another notable Java SE implementation that is licensed under the GNU GPL.</em> The implementation started when Sun began releasing the Java source code under the GPL. As of Java SE 7, OpenJDK is the official Java reference implementation.</p><p>The goal of Java is to make all implementations of Java compatible. Historically, Sun&#39;s trademark license for usage of the Java brand insists that all implementations be compatible. This resulted in a legal dispute with Microsoft after Sun claimed that the Microsoft implementation did not support RMI or JNI and had added platform-specific features of their own. Sun sued in 1997, and, in 2001, won a settlement of US$20 million, as well as a court order enforcing the terms of the license from Sun.[76] As a result, Microsoft no longer ships Java with Windows.</p><p>Platform-independent Java is essential to Java EE, and an even more rigorous validation is required to certify an implementation. This environment enables portable server-side applications.</p>', '1628112407-Java (programming language).jpg', '2021-08-04 15:26:47', '2021-08-06 14:10:32', 1),
(21, 'Automata Theory', '<p><strong>Automata Theory&nbsp;</strong>is an exciting, theoretical branch of computer science. It established its roots during the 20th Century, as mathematicians began developing - both theoretically and literally - machines which imitated certain features of man, completing calculations more quickly and reliably. The word&nbsp;<strong>automaton&nbsp;</strong>itself, closely related to the word &quot;automation&quot;, denotes automatic processes carrying out the production of specific processes. Simply stated, automata theory deals with the logic of computation with respect to simple machines, referred to as&nbsp;<strong>automata</strong>. Through automata, computer scientists are able to understand how machines compute functions and solve problems and more importantly, what it means for a function to be defined as&nbsp;<em>computable&nbsp;</em>or for a question to be described as&nbsp;<em>decidable&nbsp;</em>.</p><p><strong>Automatons&nbsp;</strong>are abstract models of machines that perform computations on an input by moving through a series of states or configurations. At each state of the computation, a transition function determines the next configuration on the basis of a finite portion of the present configuration. As a result, once the computation reaches an accepting configuration, it accepts that input. The most general and powerful automata is the&nbsp;<strong>Turing machine</strong>.</p><p>The&nbsp;<strong>major objective&nbsp;</strong>of automata theory is to develop methods by which computer scientists can describe and analyze the dynamic behavior of discrete systems, in which signals are sampled periodically. The behavior of these discrete systems is determined by the way that the system is constructed from storage and combinational elements. Characteristics of such machines include:</p><ul><li><strong>Inputs:&nbsp;</strong>assumed to be sequences of symbols selected from a finite set&nbsp;<em>I&nbsp;</em>of input signals. Namely, set&nbsp;<em>I&nbsp;</em>is the set {x1, x,2, x3... xk} where&nbsp;<em>k&nbsp;</em>is the number of inputs.</li><li><strong>Outputs:&nbsp;</strong>sequences of symbols selected from a finite set Z. Namely, set&nbsp;<em>Z&nbsp;</em>is the set {y1, y2, y3&nbsp;... ym} where&nbsp;<em>m</em>&nbsp;is the number of outputs.</li><li><strong>States:&nbsp;</strong>finite set&nbsp;<em>Q</em>, whose definition depends on the type of automaton.</li></ul><p>Next, we introduce the Turing machine, a kind of automaton that can define all the languages that can reasonably be said to be definable by any sort of computing device (the so-called &quot;recursively enumerable languages&quot;). We shall learn how &quot;problems&quot; (mathematical questions) can be expressed as languages. That lets us define problems to be &quot;decidable&quot; if their language can be defined by a Turing machine and &quot;undecidable&quot; if not. We shall see some basic undecidable problems, for example, it is undecidable whether the intersection of two context-free languages is empty.</p><p>Last, we look at the theory of intractable problems. These are problems that, while they are decidable, have almost certainly no algorithm that runs in time less than some exponential function of the size of their input. We meet the NP-complete problems, a large class of intractable problems. This class includes many of the hard combinatorial problems that have been assumed for decades or even centuries to require exponential time, and we learn that either none or all of these problems have polynomial-time algorithms. A common example of an NP-complete problem is SAT, the question of whether a Boolean expression has a truth-assignment to its variables that makes the expression itself true.</p><p>There are&nbsp;<strong>four major families of automaton&nbsp;</strong>:</p><ul><li>Finite-state machine</li><li>Pushdown automata</li><li>Linear-bounded automata</li><li>Turing machine</li></ul><p>The families of automata above can be interpreted in a hierarchal form, where the finite-state machine is the simplest automata and the Turing machine is the most complex. The focus of this project is on the finite-state machine and the Turing machine. A Turing machine is a finite-state machine yet the inverse is not true.</p><p>The exciting history of how finite automata became a branch of computer science illustrates its wide range of applications. The first people to consider the concept of a finite-state machine included a team of biologists, psychologists, mathematicians, engineers and some of the first computer scientists. They all shared a common interest: to model the human thought process, whether in the brain or in a computer. Warren McCulloch and Walter Pitts, two neurophysiologists, were the first to present a description of finite automata in 1943. Their paper, entitled, &quot;A Logical Calculus Immanent in Nervous Activity&quot;, made significant contributions to the study of neural network theory, theory of automata, the theory of computation and cybernetics. Later, two computer scientists, G.H. Mealy and E.F. Moore, generalized the theory to much more powerful machines in separate papers, published in 1955-56. The finite-state machines, the Mealy machine and the Moore machine, are named in recognition of their work. While the Mealy machine determines its outputs through the current state and the input, the Moore machine&#39;s output is based upon the current state alone.</p><p>While an automaton is called&nbsp;<em>finite&nbsp;</em>if its model consists of a finite number of states and functions with finite strings of input and output, infinite automata have an &quot;accessory&quot; - either a stack or a tape that can be moved to the right or left, and can meet the same demands made on a machine.</p><p>A&nbsp;<em>Turing machine&nbsp;</em>is formally defined by the set [Q, &Sigma;, &Gamma;, &delta;, q0, B, F] where</p><ul><li>Q = finite set of states, of which one state q0&nbsp;is the initial state</li><li>&Sigma; = a subset of &Gamma; not including B, is the set of&nbsp;<em>input symbols</em></li><li>&Gamma; = finite set of allowable tape symbols</li><li>&delta; = the&nbsp;<em>next move function&nbsp;</em>, a mapping function from Q x &Gamma; to Q x &Gamma; x {L,R}, where L and R denote the directions left and right respectively</li><li>q0&nbsp;= in set Q as the&nbsp;<em>start&nbsp;</em>state</li><li>B = a symbol of &Gamma;, as the&nbsp;<em>blank</em></li><li>F &sube; Q the set of&nbsp;<em>final states</em></li></ul><p>Therefore, the major difference between a Turing machine and two-way finite automata (FSM) lies in the fact that the Turing machine is capable of changing symbols on its tape and simulating computer execution and storage. For this reason, it can be said that the Turing Machine has the power to model all computations that can be calculated today through modern computers.</p>', '1628112765-Automata Theory.jpg', '2021-08-04 15:32:45', '2021-08-04 15:32:45', 1),
(22, 'Cloud computing', '<p><strong>Cloud computing</strong>&nbsp;is the on-demand availability of computer system resources, <em>especially data storage (cloud storage) and computing power</em>, without direct active management by the user.[2] Large clouds often have functions distributed over multiple locations, each location being a data center. Cloud computing relies on sharing of resources to achieve coherence and economies of scale.</p><p>The availability of high-capacity networks, low-cost computers and storage devices as well as the widespread adoption of hardware virtualization, service-oriented architecture and autonomic and utility computing has led to growth in cloud computing.[3][4][5] As of 2017, 90% of the public cloud runs a <strong>Linux-based operating system</strong>.[6] Clouds may be limited to a single organization (enterprise or private clouds[7][8]), or be available to multiple organizations (public cloud).</p><p>Cloud providers typically use a &quot;pay-as-you-go&quot; model, which can help in reducing capital expenses but may also lead to unexpected operating expenses for unaware users.</p><p>References to the phrase &quot;cloud computing&quot; appeared as early as 1996, with the first known mention in a Compaq internal document.[14]</p><p>The cloud symbol was used to represent networks of computing equipment in the original ARPANET by as early as 1977,[15] and the CSNET by 1981[16]&mdash;both predecessors to the Internet itself. The word cloud was used as a metaphor<em> for the Internet and a standardized cloud-like shape was used to denote a net</em>work on telephony schematics. With this simplification, the implication is that the specifics of how the endpoints of a network are connected are not relevant to understanding the diagram.[17]</p><p>The term cloud was used to refer to platforms for distributed computing as early as 1993, when Apple spin-off General Magic and AT&amp;T used it in describing their (paired) Telescript and PersonaLink technologies.[18] In Wired&#39;s April 1994 feature &quot;Bill and Andy&#39;s Excellent Adventure II&quot;, Andy Hertzfeld commented on Telescript, General Magic&#39;s distributed programming language:</p><p>&quot;The beauty of Telescript ... is that now, instead of just having a device to program, we now have the entire Cloud out there, where a single program can go and travel to many different sources of information and create a sort of a virtual service.

The ISPs, telcos, and media companies control your access. Putting all your faith in the cloud means you&#39;re also putting all your faith in continued, unfettered access. You might get it, but it&#39;ll cost you. The more bandwidth you use, the more it costs. Maybe you trust those corporations. That&#39;s fine, but there are plenty of other arguments against going into the cloud whole hog. Consider the potential for crashes. When there are problems at a company like Amazon, which provides cloud infrastructure to big name companies like Netflix and Pinterest, it can take out all those services. And more. When <strong>Amazon&#39;s S3</strong> service got mis-configured in 2017, it&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.pcmag.com/news/a-typo-took-amazon-s3-offline\">took out a hefty chunk of the entire internet</a>&nbsp;across the board. The problems typically last for only hours, but that&#39;s not much consolation at the time. To be honest, it doesn&#39;t matter.

(23, 'Blockchain', '<p>A <strong>blockchain </strong>is a growing list of records, called blocks, that are linked together using cryptography.[1][2][3][4] Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, a timestamp, and transaction data (generally represented as a Merkle tree). The timestamp proves that the transaction data existed when the block was published in order to get into its hash. As blocks each contain information about the block previous to it, they form a chain, with each additional block reinforcing the ones before it. <em>Therefore, blockchains are resistant to modification of their data because once recorded, the data in any given block cannot be altered retroactively without altering all subsequent blocks.</em></p><p>Blockchains are typically managed by a peer-to-peer network for use as a publicly distributed ledger, where nodes collectively adhere to a protocol to communicate and validate new blocks. Although blockchain records are not unalterable as forks are possible, blockchains may be considered secure by design and exemplify a distributed computing system with high Byzantine fault tolerance.</p><p>Logically, a blockchain can be seen as consisting of several layers:<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain#cite_note-21\">[21]</a></p><ul><li>infrastructure (hardware)</li><li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_layer\">networking</a>&nbsp;(node discovery, information propagation and verification)</li><li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consensus_(computer_science)\">consensus</a>&nbsp;(<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_of_work\">proof of work</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_of_stake\">proof of stake</a>)</li><li>data (blocks, transactions)</li><li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_layer\">application</a>&nbsp;(<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_contract\">smart contracts</a>/<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_application\">decentralized applications</a>, if applicable)</li></ul><p>Cryptocurrencies</p><p>Main article:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency\">Cryptocurrency</a></p><p>Most cryptocurrencies use blockchain technology to record transactions.

In Australia, The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cyber.gov.au/\">Australian Cyber Security Centre</a>&nbsp;(ACSC) regularly publishes guidance on how organizations can counter the latest cyber-security threats.&nbsp;</p><p>Types of cyber threats</p><p>The threats countered by cyber-security are three-fold:</p><p>1.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.kaspersky.com/resource-center/threats/cybercrime\"><strong>Cybercrime</strong></a>&nbsp;includes single actors or groups targeting systems for financial gain or to cause disruption.</p><p>2.&nbsp;<strong>Cyber-attack</strong>&nbsp;often involves politically motivated information gathering.</p><p>3.&nbsp;<strong>Cyberterrorism</strong>&nbsp;is intended to undermine electronic systems to cause panic or fear.</p><p>So, how do malicious actors gain control of computer systems? Here are some common methods used to threaten cyber-security:</p><p>Malware</p><p>Malware means malicious software. One of the most common cyber threats, malware is software that a cybercriminal or hacker has created to disrupt or damage a legitimate user&rsquo;s computer. Often spread via an unsolicited email attachment or legitimate-looking download, malware may be used by cybercriminals to make money or in politically motivated cyber-attacks.</p><p><strong>SQL injection</strong></p><p>An SQL (structured language query) injection is a type of cyber-attack used to take control of and steal data from a database. Cybercriminals exploit vulnerabilities in data-driven applications to insert malicious code into a databased via a malicious SQL statement. This gives them access to the sensitive information contained in the database.</p><p><strong>Phishing</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://www.kaspersky.com/resource-center/threats/spam-phishing\">Phishing</a>&nbsp;is when cybercriminals target victims with emails that appear to be from a legitimate company asking for sensitive information. Phishing attacks are often used to dupe people into handing over credit card data and other personal information.</p><p><strong>Man-in-the-middle attack</strong></p><p>A man-in-the-middle attack is a type of cyber threat where a cybercriminal intercepts communication between two individuals in order to steal data. For example, on an unsecure WiFi network, an attacker could intercept data being passed from the victim&rsquo;s device and the network.</p><p><strong>Denial-of-service attack</strong></p><p>A denial-of-service attack is where cybercriminals prevent a computer system from fulfilling legitimate requests by overwhelming the networks and servers with traffic. This renders the system unusable, preventing an organization from carrying out vital functions.</p><p><strong>Latest cyber threats</strong></p><p>What are the latest cyber threats that individuals and organizations need to guard against? Here are some of the most recent cyber threats that the U.K., U.S., and Australian governments have reported on.</p><p><strong>Dridex malware</strong></p><p>In December 2019, the U.S. Department of Justice (DoJ) charged the leader of an organized cyber-criminal group for their part in a global&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/news/uk-and-us-investigation-into-harmful-international-cyber-campaigns\">Dridex malware attack</a>. This malicious campaign affected the public, government, infrastructure and business worldwide.</p><p>Dridex is a financial trojan with a range of capabilities. Affecting victims since 2014, it infects computers though phishing emails or existing malware. Capable of stealing passwords, banking details and personal data which can be used in fraudulent transactions, it has caused massive financial losses amounting to hundreds of millions.</p><p>In response to the Dridex attacks, the U.K.&rsquo;s National Cyber Security Centre advises the public to &ldquo;ensure devices are patched, anti-virus is turned on and up to date and files are backed up&rdquo;.</p><p><strong>Romance scams</strong></p><p>In February 2020, the FBI warned U.S. citizens to be aware of confidence fraud that cybercriminals commit using dating sites, chat rooms and apps. Perpetrators take advantage of people seeking new partners, duping victims into giving away personal data.</p><p>The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.fbi.gov/contact-us/field-offices/albuquerque/news/press-releases/fbi-media-alert-avoid-becoming-a-victim-of-romance-scams\">FBI reports</a>&nbsp;that romance cyber threats affected 114 victims in New Mexico in 2019, with financial losses amounting to $1.6 million.</p><p><strong>Emotet malware</strong></p><p>In late 2019,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cyber.gov.au/acsc/view-all-content/news/national-cyber-security-committee-urges-vigilance-two-concerning-cyber-security-threats-are-wild\">The Australian Cyber Security Centre</a>&nbsp;warned national organizations about a widespread global cyber threat from Emotet malware.</p><p><a href=\"https://techxplore.com/news/2020-02-sophisticated-emotet-malware-loader-unsophisticated.html\">Emotet</a>&nbsp;is a sophisticated trojan that can steal data and also load other malware. Emotet thrives on unsophisticated password: a reminder of the importance of creating a secure password to guard against cyber threats.</p><p><strong>End-user protection</strong></p><p>End-user protection or endpoint security is a crucial aspect of cyber security. After all, it is often an individual (the end-user) who accidentally uploads malware or another form of cyber threat to their desktop, laptop or mobile device.</p><p>So, how do cyber-security measures protect end users and systems? First, cyber-security relies on cryptographic protocols to encrypt emails, files, and other critical data. This not only protects information in transit, but also guards against loss or theft.</p><p>In addition, end-user security software scans computers for pieces of malicious code, quarantines this code, and then removes it from the machine. Security programs can even detect and remove&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.kaspersky.com/resource-center/definitions/boot-sector-virus\">malicious code hidden in primary boot record</a>&nbsp;and are designed to encrypt or wipe data from computer&rsquo;s hard drive.</p><p>Electronic security protocols also focus on real-time&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.kaspersky.com/resource-center/threats/viruses-malware\">malware detection</a>. Many use heuristic and behavioral analysis to monitor the behavior of a program and its code to defend against viruses or Trojans that change their shape with each execution (polymorphic and metamorphic malware). Security programs can confine potentially malicious programs to a virtual bubble separate from a user&#39;s network to analyze their behavior and learn how to better detect new infections.</p><p>Security programs continue to evolve new defenses as cyber-security professionals identify new threats and new ways to combat them. To make the most of end-user security software, employees need to be educated about how to use it. Crucially, keeping it running and updating it frequently ensures that it can protect users against the latest cyber threats.</p>', '1628276637-Cyber Security.jpg', '2021-08-06 13:03:57', '2021-08-06 13:03:57', 2),

These tools also help engineers independently accomplish tasks (for example, deploying code or provisioning infrastructure) that normally would have required help from other teams, and this further increases a team&rsquo;s velocity.</p><p><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;How to Adopt a DevOps Model</strong></p><p><strong>DevOps Cultural Philosophy</strong></p><p>Transitioning to DevOps requires a change in culture and mindset. At its simplest, DevOps is about removing the barriers between two traditionally siloed teams, development and operations. In some organizations, there may not even be separate development and operations teams; engineers may do both. With DevOps, the two teams work together to optimize both the productivity of developers and the reliability of operations. They strive to communicate frequently, increase efficiencies, and improve the quality of services they provide to customers. They take full ownership for their services, often beyond where their stated roles or titles have traditionally been scoped by thinking about the end customer&rsquo;s needs and how they can contribute to solving those needs.&nbsp;Quality assurance and security teams may also become tightly integrated with these teams. Organizations using a DevOps model, regardless of their organizational structure, have teams that view the entire development and infrastructure lifecycle as part of their responsibilities.</p><p><strong>DevOps Practices Explained</strong></p><p>There are a few key practices that help organizations innovate faster through automating and streamlining the software development and infrastructure management processes. Most of these practices are accomplished with proper tooling.</p><p>One fundamental practice is to perform very frequent but small updates. This is how organizations innovate faster for their customers. These updates are usually more incremental in nature than the occasional updates performed under traditional release practices. Frequent but small updates make each deployment less risky. They help teams address bugs faster because teams can identify the last deployment that caused the error. Although the cadence and size of updates will vary, organizations using a DevOps model deploy updates much more often than organizations using traditional software development practices.</p><p>Organizations might also use a microservices architecture to make their applications more flexible and enable quicker innovation. The microservices architecture decouples large, complex systems into simple, independent projects. Applications are broken into many individual components (services) with each service scoped to a single purpose or function and operated independently of its peer services and the application as a whole. This architecture reduces the coordination overhead of updating applications, and when each service is paired with small, agile teams who take ownership of each service, organizations can move more quickly.</p><p>However, the combination of microservices and increased release frequency leads to significantly more deployments which can present operational challenges. Thus, DevOps practices like continuous integration and continuous delivery solve these issues and let organizations deliver rapidly in a safe and reliable manner. Infrastructure automation practices, like infrastructure as code and configuration management, help to keep computing resources elastic and responsive to frequent changes. In addition, the use of monitoring and logging helps engineers track the performance of applications and infrastructure so they can react quickly to problems.</p><p>Together, these practices help organizations deliver faster, more reliable updates to their customers.

For example, in the SQL statement&nbsp;select&nbsp;*&nbsp;from&nbsp;person&nbsp;where&nbsp;name&nbsp;=&nbsp;&#39;susan&#39;&nbsp;and&nbsp;age&nbsp;=&nbsp;2&nbsp;the string &#39;susan&#39; is data and the fragment&nbsp;and&nbsp;age&nbsp;=&nbsp;2&nbsp;is an example of a command (the value&nbsp;2&nbsp;is also data in this example).</p><p>SQL injection occurs when specially crafted user input is processed by the receiving program in a way that allows the input to exit a data context and enter a command context. This allows the attacker to alter the structure of the SQL statement which is executed.</p><p>As a simple example, imagine that the data &#39;susan&#39; in the above statement was provided by user input. The user entered the string &#39;susan&#39; (without the apostrophes) in a web form text entry field, and the program used string concatenation statements to form the above SQL statement from the three fragments&nbsp;select&nbsp;*&nbsp;from&nbsp;person&nbsp;where&nbsp;name=&#39;, the user input of &#39;susan&#39;, and&nbsp;&#39;&nbsp;and&nbsp;age&nbsp;=&nbsp;2.</p><p>Now imagine that instead of entering &#39;susan&#39; the attacker entered&nbsp;&#39;&nbsp;or&nbsp;1=1;&nbsp;--.</p><p>The program will use the same string concatenation approach with the 3 fragments of&nbsp;select&nbsp;*&nbsp;from&nbsp;person&nbsp;where&nbsp;name=&#39;, the user input of&nbsp;&#39;&nbsp;or&nbsp;1=1;&nbsp;--, and&nbsp;&#39;&nbsp;and&nbsp;age&nbsp;=&nbsp;2&nbsp;and construct the statement&nbsp;select&nbsp;*&nbsp;from&nbsp;person&nbsp;where&nbsp;name=&#39;&#39;&nbsp;or&nbsp;1=1;&nbsp;-- and age = 2. Many databases will ignore the text after the &#39;--&#39; string as this denotes a comment. The structure of the SQL command is now&nbsp;select&nbsp;*&nbsp;from&nbsp;person&nbsp;where&nbsp;name=&#39;&#39;&nbsp;or&nbsp;1=1;&nbsp;and this will select all person rows rather than just those named &#39;susan&#39; whose age is 2. The attacker has managed to craft a data string which exits the data context and entered a command context.</p><p>A more complex example is now presented.</p><p>Imagine a program creates a SQL statement using the following string assignment command&nbsp;:</p><p><em>var&nbsp;statement&nbsp;=&nbsp;&quot;SELECT * FROM users WHERE name = &#39;&quot;&nbsp;+&nbsp;userName&nbsp;+&nbsp;&quot;&#39;&quot;;</em></p><p>This SQL code is designed to pull up the records of the specified username from its table of users. However, if the &quot;userName&quot; variable is crafted in a specific way by a malicious user, the SQL statement may do more than the code author intended. For example, setting the &quot;userName&quot; variable as:</p><p>&#39; OR &#39;1&#39;=&#39;1</p><p>or using comments to even block the rest of the query (there are three types of SQL comments<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL_injection#cite_note-13\">[13]</a>). All three lines have a space at the end:</p><p>&#39; OR &#39;1&#39;=&#39;1&#39; -- &#39; OR &#39;1&#39;=&#39;1&#39; { &#39; OR &#39;1&#39;=&#39;1&#39; /*</p><p>renders one of the following SQL statements by the parent language:</p><p>SELECT * FROM users WHERE name = &#39;&#39; OR &#39;1&#39;=&#39;1&#39;;</p><p>SELECT * FROM users WHERE name = &#39;&#39; OR &#39;1&#39;=&#39;1&#39; -- &#39;;</p><p>If this code were to be used in authentication procedure then this example could be used to force the selection of every data field (*) from&nbsp;<em>all</em>&nbsp;users rather than from one specific user name as the coder intended, because the evaluation of &#39;1&#39;=&#39;1&#39; is always true.</p><p>The following value of &quot;userName&quot; in the statement below would cause the deletion of the &quot;users&quot; table as well as the selection of all data from the &quot;userinfo&quot; table (in essence revealing the information of every user), using an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API\">API</a>&nbsp;that allows multiple statements:</p><p>a&#39;;DROP TABLE users; SELECT * FROM userinfo WHERE &#39;t&#39; = &#39;t</p><p>This input renders the final SQL statement as follows and specified:</p><p>SELECT * FROM users WHERE name = &#39;a&#39;;DROP TABLE users; SELECT * FROM userinfo WHERE &#39;t&#39; = &#39;t&#39;;</p><p>While most SQL server implementations allow multiple statements to be executed with one call in this way, some SQL APIs such as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PHP\">PHP</a>&#39;s&nbsp;mysql_query()&nbsp;function do not allow this for security reasons. This prevents attackers from injecting entirely separate queries, but doesn&#39;t stop them from modifying queries.</p><p><strong>Blind SQL injection</strong></p><p>Blind SQL injection is used when a web application is vulnerable to an SQL injection but the results of the injection are not visible to the attacker. The page with the vulnerability may not be one that displays data but will display differently depending on the results of a logical statement injected into the legitimate SQL statement called for that page. This type of attack has traditionally been considered time-intensive because a new statement needed to be crafted for each bit recovered, and depending on its structure, the attack may consist of many unsuccessful requests. Recent advancements have allowed each request to recover multiple bits, with no unsuccessful requests, allowing for more consistent and efficient extraction.<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL_injection#cite_note-14\">[14]</a>&nbsp;There are several tools that can automate these attacks once the location of the vulnerability and the target information has been established.<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL_injection#cite_note-15\">[15]</a></p><p><strong>Conditional responses</strong></p><p>One type of blind SQL injection forces the database to evaluate a logical statement on an ordinary application screen. As an example, a book review website uses a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Query_string\">query string</a>&nbsp;to determine which book review to display. So the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URL\">URL</a>&nbsp;https://books.example.com/review?id=5&nbsp;would cause the server to run the query</p><p><em>SELECT * FROM bookreviews WHERE ID = &#39;5&#39;;</em></p><p>from which it would populate the review page with data from the review with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identifier\">ID</a>&nbsp;5, stored in the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Table_(database)\">table</a>&nbsp;bookreviews. The query happens completely on the server; the user does not know the names of the database, table, or fields, nor does the user know the query string. The user only sees that the above URL returns a book review. A&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_hacker\">hacker</a>&nbsp;can load the URLs&nbsp;https://books.example.com/review?id=5&nbsp;OR&nbsp;1=1&nbsp;and&nbsp;https://books.example.com/review?id=5&nbsp;AND&nbsp;1=2, which may result in queries</p><p><em>SELECT * FROM bookreviews WHERE ID = &#39;5&#39; OR &#39;1&#39;=&#39;1&#39;; SELECT * FROM bookreviews WHERE ID = &#39;5&#39; AND &#39;1&#39;=&#39;2&#39;;</em></p><p>respectively. If the original review loads with the &quot;1=1&quot; URL and a blank or error page is returned from the &quot;1=2&quot; URL, and the returned page has not been created to alert the user the input is invalid, or in other words, has been caught by an input test script, the site is likely vulnerable to an SQL injection attack as the query will likely have passed through successfully in both cases. The hacker may proceed with this query string designed to reveal the version number of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MySQL\">MySQL</a>&nbsp;running on the server:&nbsp;https://books.example.com/review?id=5&nbsp;AND&nbsp;substring(@@version,&nbsp;1,&nbsp;INSTR(@@version,&nbsp;&#39;.&#39;)&nbsp;-&nbsp;1)=4, which would show the book review on a server running MySQL 4 and a blank or error page otherwise. The hacker can continue to use code within query strings to achieve their goal directly, or to glean more information from the server in hopes of discovering another avenue of attack.</p><p><strong>Second order SQL injection</strong></p><p>Second order SQL injection occurs when submitted values contain malicious commands that are stored rather than executed immediately. In some cases, the application may correctly encode an SQL statement and store it as valid SQL. Then, another part of that application without controls to protect against SQL injection might execute that stored SQL statement. This attack requires more knowledge of how submitted values are later used. Automated web application security scanners would not easily detect this type of SQL injection and may need to be manually instructed where to check for evidence that it is being attempted.</p><p><strong>Mitigation</strong></p><p>An SQL injection is a well known attack and easily prevented by simple measures. After an apparent SQL injection attack on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TalkTalk_Group\">TalkTalk</a>&nbsp;in 2015, the BBC reported that security experts were stunned that such a large company would be vulnerable to it.</p><p><strong>Object Relational Mappers</strong></p><p>Developers can use ORM frameworks such as Hibernate&nbsp;to create database queries in a safe and developer-friendly way. Since database queries are no longer constructed as strings, there is no danger of an injection vulnerability.</p><p><strong>Web Application Firewalls</strong></p><p>While WAF products such as ModSecurity CRS&nbsp;cannot prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities from creeping into a codebase, they can make discovery and exploitation significantly more challenging to an attacker.</p><p><strong>Detection</strong></p><p>SQL injection filtering works in similar way to emails spam filters. Database firewalls detect SQL injections based on the number of invalid queries from host, the presence of OR and UNION blocks inside of the request, or other characteristics.</p><p><strong>Parameterized statements</strong></p><p>Main article:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prepared_statement\">Prepared statement</a></p><p>With most development platforms, parameterized statements that work with parameters can be used (sometimes called placeholders or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bind_variable\">bind variables</a>) instead of embedding user input in the statement. A placeholder can only store a value of the given type and not an arbitrary SQL fragment. Hence the SQL injection would simply be treated as a strange (and probably invalid) parameter value. In many cases, the SQL statement is fixed, and each parameter is a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalar_(computing)\">scalar</a>, not a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Table_(database)\">table</a>. The user input is then assigned (bound) to a parameter.<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL_injection#cite_note-23\">[23]</a></p><p>Easily put, using parameterized queries can definitely prevent SQL injection. This mainly means that your variables aren&#39;t query strings that would accept arbitrary SQL inputs, however, some parameters of given types are definitely necessary. Parameterized queries require the developer to define all the code. Therefore, without parameterized queries, anyone could put any kind of SQL code into the field, and have the database erased. But if the parameters were to set to &#39;@username&#39; then the person would only be able to put in a username without any kind of code.<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL_injection#cite_note-24\">[24]</a></p><p><strong>Enforcement at the coding level</strong></p><p>Using&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-relational_mapping\">object-relational mapping</a>&nbsp;libraries avoids the need to write SQL code. The ORM library in effect will generate parameterized SQL statements from object-oriented code.</p><p><strong>Escaping</strong></p><p>A popular, though error-prone and ultimately doomed way to prevent injections is to attempt to escape all characters that have a special meaning in SQL. The manual for an SQL DBMS explains which characters have a special meaning, which allows creating a comprehensive&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blacklist_(computing)\">blacklist</a>&nbsp;of characters that need translation. For instance, every occurrence of a single quote (&#39;) in a parameter must be replaced by two single quotes (&#39;&#39;) to form a valid SQL string literal. For example, in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PHP\">PHP</a>&nbsp;it is usual to escape parameters using the function&nbsp;mysqli_real_escape_string();&nbsp;before sending the SQL query:</p><p>$mysqli = new mysqli(&#39;hostname&#39;, &#39;db_username&#39;, &#39;db_password&#39;, &#39;db_name&#39;); $query = sprintf(&quot;SELECT * FROM `Users` WHERE UserName=&#39;%s&#39; AND Password=&#39;%s&#39;&quot;, $mysqli-&gt;real_escape_string($username), $mysqli-&gt;real_escape_string($password)); $mysqli-&gt;query($query);</p><p>This function prepends backslashes to the following characters:&nbsp;\\x00,&nbsp;\\n,&nbsp;\\r,&nbsp;\\,&nbsp;&#39;,&nbsp;&quot;&nbsp;and&nbsp;\\x1a. This function is normally used to make data safe before sending a query to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MySQL\">MySQL</a>.<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL_injection#cite_note-25\">[25]</a><br />PHP has similar functions for other database systems such as pg_escape_string() for&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PostgreSQL\">PostgreSQL</a>. The function&nbsp;addslashes(string $str)&nbsp;works for escaping characters, and is used especially for querying on databases that do not have escaping functions in PHP. It returns a string with backslashes before characters that need to be escaped in database queries, etc. These characters are single quote (&#39;), double quote (&quot;), backslash (\\) and NUL (the NULL byte).<br />Routinely passing escaped strings to SQL is error prone because it is easy to forget to escape a given string. Creating a transparent layer to secure the input can reduce this error-proneness, if not entirely eliminate it.</p><p>Pattern check</p><p>Integer, float or boolean, string parameters can be checked if their value is valid representation for the given type. Strings that must follow some strict pattern (date, UUID, alphanumeric only, etc.) can be checked if they match this pattern.</p><p>Database permissions[<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=SQL_injection&amp;action=edit&amp;section=16\">edit</a>]</p><p>Limiting the permissions on the database login used by the web application to only what is needed may help reduce the effectiveness of any SQL injection attacks that exploit any bugs in the web application.</p><p>For example, on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_SQL_Server\">Microsoft SQL Server</a>, a database logon could be restricted from selecting on some of the system tables which would limit exploits that try to insert JavaScript into all the text columns in the database.</p><p>deny select on sys.sysobjects to webdatabaselogon;

That changed when more and more programmers became acquainted with computer virus programming and created viruses that manipulated or even destroyed data on infected computers.<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antivirus_software#cite_note-18\">[18]</a></p><p>Before&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet\">internet</a>&nbsp;connectivity was widespread, computer viruses were typically spread by infected&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floppy_disk\">floppy disks</a>. Antivirus software came into use, but was updated relatively infrequently. During this time, virus checkers essentially had to check executable files and the boot sectors of floppy disks and hard disks.

An incorrect decision may lead to a security breach. If the antivirus software employs heuristic detection, it must be fine-tuned to minimize misidentifying harmless software as malicious (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_positive\">false positive</a>).<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antivirus_software#cite_note-151\">[151]</a></p><p>Antivirus software itself usually runs at the highly trusted&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_(computing)\">kernel</a>&nbsp;level of the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system\">operating system</a>&nbsp;to allow it access to all the potential malicious process and files, creating a potential avenue of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attack_(computing)\">attack</a>.<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antivirus_software#cite_note-152\">[152]</a>&nbsp;The US&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Security_Agency\">National Security Agency</a>&nbsp;(NSA) and the UK&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_Communications_Headquarters\">Government Communications Headquarters</a>&nbsp;(GCHQ) intelligence agencies, respectively, have been exploiting anti-virus software to spy on users.<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antivirus_software#cite_note-153\">[153]</a>&nbsp;Anti-virus software has highly privileged and trusted access to the underlying operating system, which makes it a much more appealing target for remote attacks.<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antivirus_software#cite_note-Kaspersky-targeted-154\">[154]</a>&nbsp;Additionally anti-virus software is &quot;years behind security-conscious client-side applications like browsers or document readers. It means that Acrobat Reader, Microsoft Word or Google Chrome are harder to exploit than 90 percent of the anti-virus products out there&quot;, according to Joxean Koret, a researcher with Coseinc, a Singapore-based information security consultancy.</p><p><strong>Online scanning</strong></p><p>Some antivirus vendors maintain websites with free online scanning capability of the entire computer, critical areas only, local disks, folders or files. Periodic online scanning is a good idea for those that run antivirus applications on their computers because those applications are frequently slow to catch threats. One of the first things that malicious software does in an attack is disable any existing antivirus software and sometimes the only way to know of an attack is by turning to an online resource that is not installed on the infected computer.<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antivirus_software#cite_note-159\">[159]</a></p><p><strong>Specialized tools</strong></p><p>The command-line&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rkhunter\">rkhunter</a>&nbsp;scanner, an engine to scan for&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux\">Linux</a>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rootkit\">rootkits</a>&nbsp;running on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubuntu_(operating_system)\">Ubuntu</a>.</p><p>Virus removal tools are available to help remove stubborn infections or certain types of infection.
